"""Unit tests for the quote recognizer (quote_rewrite.extract_quote).

Each case is drawn from the real note corpus in patches/ — this is the
characterization suite the recognizer was honed on. The flipcommons DB
migration embeds a byte-identical copy of the recognizer; its equivalence
property test is what catches cross-repo divergence.
