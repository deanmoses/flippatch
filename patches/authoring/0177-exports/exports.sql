-- Export-candidate analysis for the 0177-exports campaign.
--
-- Goal: find every catalog model built for a foreign market, and decompose the
-- candidates into review buckets that are first-cut worklists for the data patches
-- setting `export_edition_of` and `ModelExportMarket`. This is the DISCOVERY layer;
-- per-row judgement and patch authoring are downstream (see this dir's README.md).
-- Flippatch owns this analysis — flipcommons' Exports.md, which specifies the two
-- catalog structures, links here rather than carrying a copy.
--
-- PLAN-LOCAL LAYER. The generic catalog decode (models/countries/rewards/title_size
-- and the read-only connection) is FLIPCOMMONS' shared foundation, reused VERBATIM
-- via the `.read` below — flippatch keeps no copy. Same pattern as
-- ../0128-relationships/relationships.sql and ../0172-bingo-game-format/bingo.sql.
--
-- HOW TO RUN. cwd must be the flipcommons checkout so BOTH the `.read` below AND the
-- foundation's own `ATTACH backend/db.sqlite3` resolve there. `make analyze` handles
-- the cwd/path resolution and delegates to flipcommons' shared runner, which prints
-- the analysis_context watermark + export_summary and gates on export_checks. Do not
-- run this file directly:
--
--     P=patches/authoring/0177-exports/exports.sql
--     make analyze PLAN=$P PREFIX=export                              # summary, gated on checks
--     make analyze PLAN=$P Q="FROM export_twin_pairs;"                # deterministic export_edition_of
--     make analyze PLAN=$P Q="FROM export_titlemate_review;"          # likely target sits in the same Title
--     make analyze PLAN=$P Q="FROM export_orphan_review;"             # candidates still needing a target
--     make analyze PLAN=$P Q="FROM export_market_review;"             # the ModelExportMarket shape per candidate
--     make analyze PLAN=$P CMD=ui                                     # live GUI at localhost:4213
--
-- Nothing is persisted; there is no build artifact. Counts are a snapshot of
-- current DB state — re-run as candidates get reviewed. `export_summary` emits
-- the headline numbers the README quotes; `export_checks` is empty when healthy.
--
-- The notes detectors are freetext heuristics: they over- and under-count and
-- every row needs source review before it becomes a claim (see README.md).
--
-- STRUCTURE — a plan file has four sections (see flipcommons' scripts/analysis/README.md).
-- Three are the same in every analysis; only section 3 is shaped by the question:
--   1 · FOUNDATION       .read the shared decode layer
--   2 · REFERENCE        plan-local hand-maintained lookups (often empty)
--   3 · ANALYSIS         the actual work — this file's shape is detect ->
--                        assemble -> enrich -> review; yours may differ
--   4 · SUMMARY & CHECKS the tail that keeps the prose honest — always keep it

-- ── 1 · FOUNDATION ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
.read scripts/analysis/catalog.sql

-- ── 2 · REFERENCE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Hand-maintained lookups specific to this analysis. Not derived from the DB.

-- Country resolution for the detectors. The catalog owns the country vocabulary
-- (`countries`); this maps the free-text TOKENS the detectors pull from notes and
-- names to a catalog country SLUG, so markets are stored as slugs that align with
-- each model's maker-home `country_slug`. Three token kinds aren't a catalog name and
-- need an alias: the IPDB US spellings, the acronyms/alternate names ("UK", "Holland"),
-- and the adjectives in "for the German market". Everything else resolves by name.
-- Slugs are never hardcoded — `countries` supplies them, so a country rename can't
-- silently desync this lookup. (A destination country that isn't in `countries` at all,
-- e.g. Israel, resolves the moment it's created as a Location — no alias needed.)
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW _country_alias AS
  SELECT * FROM (VALUES
    ('USA','United States of America'), ('United States','United States of America'),
    ('UK','United Kingdom'), ('Holland','Netherlands'),
    ('Italian','Italy'), ('Spanish','Spain'), ('French','France'), ('German','Germany'),
    ('Portuguese','Portugal'), ('Japanese','Japan'), ('Brazilian','Brazil'),
    ('Belgian','Belgium'), ('British','United Kingdom'), ('American','United States of America')
  ) AS t(token, country_name);

-- Region labels for the `target_market_label` case (flipcommons' Exports.md): a market
-- that is a multi-country region, not a catalog country. Unlike countries these have NO catalog
-- vocabulary to draw on (a region isn't a Location), so the canonical label is
-- hand-declared here — this IS the closed set `market_kind = 'region'` validates
-- against. `pattern` is a case-insensitive regex requiring EXPORT context around the
-- region word, because the bare word is mostly noise ("European football" theme, "a
-- European distributor", a collector "in Europe"). Keep patterns tight; a false region
-- hit invents a market. Only Europe recurs in the data today; the row shape is ready
-- for Scandinavia/Benelux/Latin America if they ever surface.

-- ── 3 · ANALYSIS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- This analysis hunts candidate export models, so its shape is:
--   detect   surface candidates from several independent signals (the _by_*,
--            _dest_* helpers below)
--   assemble union the signals into one row per candidate (export_candidates)
--   enrich   join in existing lineage edges (export_candidate_lineage)
--   review   slice the candidates into the human-review buckets (export_*_review,
--            export_name_family)
-- A different question wants a different shape — classify, aggregate, diff, etc.
-- Keep sections 1, 2 and 4; rebuild this one for your plan.

-- detect ──
-- Detector 1 (membership): any model whose notes carry export-edition phrasing.
-- Scope is *any model built for export*, so this is NOT gated on a named market
-- (the market is parsed separately below and may be empty). The one exclusion is
-- the "quantity produced for export: N" production statistic — a sales figure
-- nearly every Williams/Gottlieb game carries — which is blanked before matching
-- so it can't create a candidate on its own, yet a note that ALSO carries real
-- export phrasing (e.g. Yukon (Special)) is still kept.
-- NOTE: "for the <X> market" phrasing was REMOVED from membership — it was mostly
-- noise. The unbounded `%for the % market%` bridged unrelated text (4-IN-1's "sell ...
-- to the home market" became a hit), and even bounded it caught domestic markets. Of
-- the 42 candidates it uniquely supplied, only ~5 were genuine foreign-market exports.
-- Those hits are now PARKED in `export_market_phrase_review` for a separate, careful
-- pass, rather than polluting the candidate set. (`_dest_market` below still parses the
-- phrase into a country for models that ARE candidates by other signals — that's fine.)
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW _by_notes AS

    SELECT id, regexp_replace(COALESCE(ipdb_notes, ''), '(?i)quantity produced for export', '', 'g') AS n

  WHERE n ILIKE '%for export%'
     OR n ILIKE '%export to %'
     OR n ILIKE '%export edition%' OR n ILIKE '%export version%' OR n ILIKE '%export model%';

-- The _dest_* views below parse the destination MARKET from the notes/name. They
-- feed the `markets` column, not candidate membership — a by_notes candidate with
-- no parseable country simply has empty markets.

-- "export to <Country>[ and/then <Country>...]" — resolve each parsed token to a
-- country slug. Two shapes the naive single-token regex missed:
--   list      "export to Israel and Indonesia", "export to Brazil then Italy" — capture
--             the whole run (tokens chained by " and "/" then ") and split it, so the
--             tail country isn't dropped.
--   acronym   "export to the USA", "export to the UK" — the token charset allows
--             all-caps runs (USA/UK), resolved via `_country_alias`.
-- The country charset deliberately over-captures (any capitalized run); a token that
-- isn't a country simply drops at the `_country_lookup` join. A leading "the " on a
-- list tail (". . . and the UK") is stripped before lookup.

-- ("add-a-ball export version", "4-player export version"), and any capitalized
-- non-country simply drops at the `_country_lookup` join.
-- Caveat: the adjective could in principle name the maker's ORIGIN rather than the

-- Detector 4 (membership AND exclusion): the FORMULAIC TWIN sentence — the highest-
-- quality signal in the notes. Spanish-market makers ran paired brands, one domestic and
-- one export (Petaco/Recel, Recreativos Franco/Interflip), and IPDB writes BOTH sides:
--   domestic side: "Petaco is the name used for domestic games.
--                   The same company made an export version as Recel's 1980 'Black Magic'."
--   export side:   "Recel is the name used for export games.
--                   The same company made a domestic version as Petaco's 'Black Magic'."
-- Each model states its OWN role and NAMES its counterpart, so this needs no maker-level
-- inference and no maker lookup table: a model whose note says the TWIN is "domestic" is
-- itself the export, and vice versa. That makes it usable in both directions — it adds
-- export-side models as candidates and positively EXCLUDES the domestic side, which the
-- freetext detectors otherwise flag (a Petaco note says "export" only because it is
-- naming its Recel twin).
-- Shape notes: the qualifier floats around the keyword ("a 1-player domestic version",
-- "a domestic 4-player version", "a domestic SS version") and the article varies
-- (a/an/the), so both slots are optional word-runs. All 58 occurrences parse.
-- The independent "is the name used for <role> games" sentence is captured as
-- `declared_role` purely to cross-check the twin sentence; the two never disagree today,
-- and `export_checks` fails loudly if they ever do.
-- MATERIALIZED (a TABLE, not a view) — the one exception in this file. The regex below
-- is backtracking-heavy, and `_twin` is inlined into `export_candidates`, which
-- `export_summary` reference-expands ~20 times; as a view the parse re-runs on every one
-- of those and exhausts memory. A table computes it once at init. Nothing is persisted
