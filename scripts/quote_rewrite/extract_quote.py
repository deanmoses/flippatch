"""The quote recognizer: pull a verbatim source quote out of a legacy ``note:``.

Legacy notes carry evidence as ``<source> says "<quote>"`` scaffolding; the
quote now belongs on the citation (``cite.quote``). This module is the pure
transform both migration consumers share: the flippatch patch-rewrite script
here, and the flipcommons DB data migration, which embeds a byte-identical
copy (the repos share no runtime dependency). Change one, change both — the
``rewrite-then-ingest ≡ ingest-then-migrate`` property test in flipcommons
catches divergence.

Deliberately conservative: only the confidently-shaped notes match; anything
with substantive prose outside the quoted spans returns ``None`` and is fixed
by hand. Every proposed rewrite gets human review via a before/after diff, so
the recognizer optimizes for "never mangles" over "always matches".
